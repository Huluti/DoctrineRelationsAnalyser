## Overview

Doctrine Relations Analyzer is a tool designed to analyze and visualize cascade relationships within Doctrine ORM entities in Symfony projects. It helps developers understand how deletion operations propagate through related entities and assists in identifying potential issues or optimizations in data management strategies.

> [!NOTE]
>**Why is it important?**
>
>Managing cascade operations, especially deletions, is crucial to avoid unintentional data loss. This tool provides a human-readable summary to help developers review and understand these relationships, ensuring they are intentional and correctly implemented.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is a work in progress. Contributions and feedback are welcome.

```

### Usage

#### Analysis

Command to easily visualise the relationships between Doctrine entities

    php bin/console doctrine-relations-analyser:analyse

##### Command-line Arguments

- --entities: Optional. Comma-separated list of entities to analyze
- -m, --mode: Optional. Analysis mode (all, deletions) [default: "all"]
- -o, --output: Optional. Output path for reports generated
- -g, --graph: Optional. Generate Graphviz graph
- --graph-format: Optional. Graph image format (png, svg) [default: "png"]
- -V, --version: Optional. Display help for the given command. When no command is given display help for the list command
- -h, --help: Optional. Display this application version

#### Examples

To check deletion relations of two entities in a graph:

    php bin/console doctrine-relations-analyser:analyse -o data/ -g --entities="App\\Entity\\User,App\\Entity\\Workspace" -m deletions

#### Validation

Command to validate Doctrine relationships between entities against configuration file of bundle. It can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to ensure that the expected relationships are maintained.

    php bin/console doctrine-relations-analyser:validate

##### Configuration file

The configuration file is located at `config/packages/doctrine_relations_analyser.yaml`. It allows you to define the expected relationships between entities, including which entities should be deleted when a parent entity is deleted.

        comments:
          class: DoctrineRelationsAnalyserBundle\Tests\Entity\Comment
          deletion: true

```

##### Command-line Arguments
